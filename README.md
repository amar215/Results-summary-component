## My process
I used flexbox to align the cards.
I used all the different CSS properties I could to practice CSS.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I understood the use of 'nth-child' property.
I learned about SVG's as well.

I look forward to your contructive criticism.
